# Learning-Blockchain

### ```Blockchain and Blocks```
##### Blockchain is a data structure that was first introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin protocol white paper almost a decade ago.

##### A block is a data structure that contains transactions, files or any data you like, really. Much like linkedlists, blocks can be linked- or chained in this case- together to form a blockchain. This is achieved by the use of hashes.

### ```Hash Functions```
##### A hash function is simply a function that takes in input value, and from that input creates an output value deterministic of the input value. The input can be any data- numbers, files, etc. A hash is usually displayed as a hexadecimal number. This has several different purposes including:
> cryptography
> comrpession
> checksum generation
> data indexing
> blockchaining

*There are many different hash algorithms available such as:*
- md5 (message digest 5)
- NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager)
- SHA-1 (Secure Hashing Algorithm)
- SHA-2
- SHA-256 (used by bitcoin)

##### The Bitcoin protocol uses a blockchain to store transaction data (but you can store anything really)
